"""
REVISION PACKAGE 4 — Coaching controller (isolated, additive).

Makes the learner-facing coaching turn CONSUME the Sprint-3 structured decision
instead of independently inferring what to teach. It does NOT redesign Stage C, the
dialogue, the scaffolding sequences, or the CIO knowledge base. It selects one of the
mandated response PATHS from the stored decision and gates/adjusts the learner-facing
text accordingly:

  CASE 1  READY + NEEDS_INSTRUCTION              -> use the frozen engine's single-target
                                                    coaching invitation (unchanged).
  CASE 2  READY + NO_CURRENT_INSTRUCTIONAL_TARGET-> acknowledge strengths; invent no weakness.
  CASE 3  BLOCKED_*                              -> gather only the needed evidence; no teaching.
  CASE 4  TEACHER_OVERRIDE                       -> focus on the teacher-selected target
                                                    (engine recommendation preserved in audit).

The controller never re-diagnoses and never substitutes a different target; it consumes
the decision as computed for THIS turn. It never performs the learner's cognitive work.
