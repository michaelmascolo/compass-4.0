"""LOG-ONLY dry run for the proposed layered anti-leakage architecture.

This DOES NOT change production behavior. It:
  1. Generates the Layer-1 draft (Haiku + the LIVE hardened prompt, imported
     read-only from organizing_thought) for a set of weak-answer cases.
  2. Runs a CANDIDATE Layer-2 deterministic checker (defined here only) in
     log-only mode.
  3. Establishes GROUND TRUTH with a Sonnet "pedagogical leakage judge" that
     applies the governing principle: could a student infer the substantive
     answer from (assignment + own response + Compass's message) WITHOUT
     consulting their own knowledge or source?
  4. Also runs hand-crafted adversarial messages (including semantic leaks that
     introduce NO new domain tokens) to probe false negatives / unnecessary
     escalation.
  5. Reports flag rate, FP, FN, latency, escalation-type distribution, and
     example misses.
