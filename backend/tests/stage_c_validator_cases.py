"""Stage C validator — labeled cases for the 'ready-made sentence' rule (Phase II Step 4).

Each case: a representative Stage C coaching draft + the student's excerpt + whether
the constitutional rule SHOULD flag it (supplying a submittable sentence that performs
the student's target operation) vs an ACCEPTABLE scaffold that must NOT be flagged.

Categories:
  genuine_readymade  — a polished on-topic sentence the student could paste as their answer  -> SHOULD flag
  reader_attributed  — a quote attributed to a reader/skeptic (illustrative objection)        -> must NOT flag
  sentence_frame     — a template/frame with a blank/placeholder                              -> must NOT flag
  student_quote      — quoting the student's OWN existing wording (recognition)               -> must NOT flag
  revision_question  — a focused question in quotes                                           -> must NOT flag
  structural_example — a generic example clearly not answering THIS assignment               -> must NOT flag
  operation_named    — merely names a writing operation, no submittable sentence             -> must NOT flag
