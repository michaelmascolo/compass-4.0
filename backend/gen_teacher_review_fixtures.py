    ("student-b", "Student B", "I believe our school should allow personal cell phones during class. Phones can actually help students learn because we can look up information quickly and use apps for studying. Some teachers even use phones for classroom activities like polls. As long as students use them responsibly, phones can be a useful tool instead of a distraction."),
    ("student-c", "Student C", "While many worry that cell phones distract students, our school should allow them during class under clear guidelines. Phones are powerful learning tools: students can access research, translate unfamiliar terms, and organize assignments in seconds. A complete ban assumes students cannot learn self-control, yet responsible use is itself a skill worth teaching. Rather than removing phones entirely, teachers could set 'phone-on' and 'phone-off' times, helping students practice the judgment they will need long after high school."),
    ("student-d", "Student D", "My favorite thing about school is lunchtime because I get to see my friends and we talk about weekend plans. The cafeteria food isn't always great, but sometimes they have pizza which everyone likes. I also enjoy gym class because we get to play basketball. School would be better if we had longer breaks between classes."),
    ("student-e", "Student E", "Personal cell phones should be allowed during class when they are used for educational purposes and within clearly defined expectations. They provide students with immediate access to information, digital learning resources, and organizational tools that can enhance classroom learning. In addition, learning to use technology responsibly is an important skill that students will need beyond school. Although phones can become distracting if misused, thoughtful classroom guidelines can minimize these concerns while preserving the educational benefits. Overall, allowing responsible phone use creates opportunities for both academic growth and personal responsibility."),
    ("student-f", "Student F", "In my opinion the school need to allow the phone in class. Many student use phone for translate the difficult word, this help us to understand the lesson better. Also when we don't understand, we can search fast the information. If the school ban all phone, is more hard for student like me who still learning English. So I think phone can help if we use with respect."),
