"""Developmental Operations Library (Canonical Mode).

An internal catalogue of the intellectual TRANSFORMATIONS Compass teaches — the move
from a learner's current form of thought (e.g. a story, an observation, an example)
to the next, more organized form (e.g. its meaning, a thesis, a principle).

Compass does not merely identify a problem ("this needs elaboration"); it teaches the
OPERATION that carries the learner from their current draft to the next. Each entry
names the two intellectual forms, the reader-understanding gap between them, and a
coaching strategy for teaching the transformation (a strategy to ADAPT, never a fixed
sentence to recite). The dialogue model selects the ONE operation a turn requires and
teaches it; these are guidance, not templates. Content stays the learner's own.
